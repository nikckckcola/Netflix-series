# Netflix-series
This project involves analyzing data from Netflix. The main goals are to understand various aspects of the available content, such as the cast, release year, duration, genre, etc. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes several libraries for data analysis and visualization.

There are some of the goals that I reached:
1. In which year highest number of the tv shows and movies were released? Show it with bar graph.

2. Show all the movies that were released in 2000.
3. Show top 10 directors who gave the highest number of tv shows and movies.
4. How many movies and tv shows are in the dataset? Show it with bar graph.
